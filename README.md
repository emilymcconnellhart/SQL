# SQL
Hello and welcome! This code repository is home to examples of SQL I've written and projects I've completed throughout my journey of learning SQL and data analytics. Please feel free to take a look around and reach out if you have any questions. 

Note - projects are assignments from Charlotte Chaze's Teachable course Break Into Tech.
